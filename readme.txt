In case you have problems with translations, we do our best to help you.

= Do I need WPML extension to use this plugin? =
Yes, you need to install WPML plugin and its related plugins(WPML Translation Manager, WPML String Translation).
You will also need Woocommerce Multilingual if you want to translate Product information.

= How to get the mLang API token? = 
To receive an API key, you need to Sign Up on the https://mylang.me/ website and create a API Token key in your dashboard. For new users, there are 5 thousand free symbols available for translation.
Moreover WordPress users can use coupon code WordPress2022 and get 50 000 000 symbols for free until the end of 2022.

= What content is translatable? =
The plugin supports translation for Pages, Posts and Products.
For translation are available: general information, HTML text and metadata.

= AIOSEO (All in One SEO) and Yoast SEO support? =
WPML supports only AIOSEO with Pro rate. That's why we did not include such support. Write to us if you really need it.
MyLang fully supports Yoast SEO.

= Does the plugin work with Visual Editors? =
Such convenient editors as Elementor, Visual composer, Brizy, Divi, etc., are very handy, but unfortunately they have very "dirty" HTML code. So myLang plugin can work with them, but it shouldn't. You should also keep in mind that WPML should support your visual editor at first.
